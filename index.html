<h1> Galois Theory Course Skeleton </h1>

<div style = "line-height: normal;">Concepts are listed in roughly the reverse chronological order in which we covered them in class. Try mousing over a topic; if it was in some sense fundamental to the class (either we didn't prove/define it, or we proved/defined it based on material learned in other classes), it will glow <p style = "background-color: palevioletred; display: inline; padding: 3px;">red</p>, but if it glows <p style = "background-color: lightgreen; display: inline; padding: 3px;">green</p>, it depends on other topics which will glow <p style = "background-color: lightblue; display: inline; padding: 3px;">blue</p>.
